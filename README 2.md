# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of software systems.
 software engineering differs with traditional systems since it uses advaced technology and evolved programming language.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
a.Requirements: where indivduals gather information on system requirements and userneeds.
b. Design: creation of high-level and detailed software architecture and user interphase.
c. Implementation: coding and building software according to system functionality.
d. Testing: Tests are conducted to ensure software meet standards and functional requirements.
e. Deployment: Software is released to users.
f. Maintenance: Providing software with mmaintenance,support, and enhancements.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile is the iterative and incremental approach that focuses on collaboration,flexibity and change, while waterfall it is a sequential approach which flows downwards. Also,Agile focuses on flexibility and change while waterfall focuses of sequences of activities from up to down.Agile is applicable to big and long-term projects which are evolving, while waterfall is for small and short-term projects.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirement engineering is where systems asre developed and tested to ensure they meet user needs and system requirements. Requirement engineering is essential in  software development cycle since they ensure systems comply with predifined requirements andfunctionality.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
Modularity concept in software design is where  software systems are divided into modeules which are manageable, distinct, and independent.It improves scalability  by promoting expansion of system and improving performance, while it promotes maintainability by making system updates easier, simpifying testing and isolating  changes.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
1.Unit testing: the testing of individual module of a software.
2.Intergration testing: is testing  interactions between different  subsystems and components.
3. System testing: testing the whole system.
4. Acceptance testing: testing a system against user requirements to ensure it meet the user needs. 
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems track changes in codes and cordinate work amongst team members.
version control system are important in software development because the promote team collaboration, keep records of code changes, and promotes code reviews.Examples of version control system include Git and subversion. Git has features like  community support and its ability to  intergrate with other deveolpment tools, while subversion has atomic commits and centralized repisitory.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
Software project manager responsibilities are budgeting, scheduleing, team leadership, stakeholders' management, and risk management. However, challenges in software project management are scope creep, limited resources, poor communication,unrealistic deadline, and poor risk management. 
Software Mainenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is the act of updating software after launching to  correct faults and enhance its perfomance.Software maintenance involves activities like fixing defects, adding new features or improving them. Software maintenace is essential in software lifecycle since it improves performance, satisfys clinets, and reduces cost.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Software engineers face ethical issues like data privacy,transparency, intellectual propery, reliabilty, and accountability.However, they cam adhere to ethical standards by adhering to professional codes and standards,continous education of professional ethics, and being transparent.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
